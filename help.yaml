## 🧩 How It Works

### 1️⃣ User Joins
- When the page loads, a modal asks for the user's name.
- The name is sent to the server via the `join` event.

### 2️⃣ Location Tracking Starts
- Browser continuously watches the user's location using `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition()`.
- Coordinates (`latitude`, `longitude`) are sent to the server via `send-location`.

### 3️⃣ Real-Time Broadcast
- The server receives the data and broadcasts it to **all clients** via `receive-location`.

### 4️⃣ Map Updates
- Each client updates the corresponding user's marker position.
- A **polyline trail** is drawn showing movement history.

### 5️⃣ Disconnection Handling
- When a user leaves, the server emits a `user-disconnected` event.
- Their marker and trail are removed from all connected clients’ maps.
